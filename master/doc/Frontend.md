# Crawl Infra Frontend

## Problem

It's too cumbersome to manage all crawling tasks all the time via commandline.

Therefore, it makes sense to create a minimalistic frontend for the crawling infra.

## What frontend UI lib to use?

- react with typescript
- either https://material-ui.com/ or https://ant.design/

## Setup

```bash
npx create-react-app frontend --typescript
```

### Install ant.d design 

https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app

### Start the app

Run the frontend

```bash
yarn start
```
